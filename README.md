# Maze Generator and Shortest Path Finding

A Python + Pygame project to visualize maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- 🧱 Maze Generation using Randomized Prim’s Algorithm
- 🚀 Shortest Path Algorithms:
  - Dijkstra
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search
  - Q-Learning + Depth First Search
- 🖱️ Interactive board with wall drawing, start/target setting
- 🎮 GUI built with Pygame

## Setup
